Monday Assigment:

1. Write a method that takes 2 parameters - a string and a positive integer(n). It should return a larger string that is n copies of the original string
 
Test Cases:
stringTimes(“Hi”, 2) -> HiHi
stringTimes(“Hi”, 3) -> HiHiHi
stringTimes(“Hi”, 1) -> Hi
 
 
 
2. Write a lottery method which takes 3 integer values. If two of the numbers are same, the result is 10. If all of the numbers are same, the result is 20. If all of the numbers are different, the result is 0.
 
Test Cases:
greenTicket(1,2,3) -> 0
greenTicket(2,2,2) -> 20
greenTicket(1,1,2) -> 10
 
3. Write a method that counts the number of “xx” in the given string. We’ll say that overlapping is allowed, so “xxx” contains 2 “xx”.
 
Test Cases:
countXX(“abcxx”) -> 1
countXX(“xxx”) -> 2
countXX(“xxxx”) -> 3
 
 
4. The squirrels spend most of their day playing. In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90(inclusive). Unless its summer, then they play when the temperature is between 60 to 100. Write a method that takes an int temperature and a boolean values, it returns true if the squirrel play and false otherwise.
 
Test Cases:
squirrelPlay(70, false) -> true
squirrelPlay(95, false) -> false
squirrelPlay(95, true) -> true
